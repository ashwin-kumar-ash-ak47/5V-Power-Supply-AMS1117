# 5V Power Supply using AMS1117

This repository contains the schematic for a 5V regulated power supply using the AMS1117-5.0 voltage regulator.

## Components
- AMS1117-5.0 – Voltage Regulator
- 10µF Capacitors – Input & Output Filtering
- 1N4007 – Polarity Protection Diode
- J1 & J2 – Input/Output Connectors

## How it works
The input voltage (e.g. 9V) passes through the 1N4007 diode, then gets regulated to 5V by the AMS1117. Capacitors on both sides ensure a stable and clean 5V output.
